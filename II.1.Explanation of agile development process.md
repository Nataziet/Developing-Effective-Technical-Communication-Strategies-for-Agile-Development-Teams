# **Explanation of agile development process**

Agile development process is a flexible and iterative approach to software development that concentrates on delivering value progressively and adapting to change fast. Collaboration, client input, and ongoing progress are highlighted.

Here is an overview of the typical steps involved in an agile development process:

1. The agile development process begins with project initiation, during which the team determines the project's goals, boundaries, and stakeholders. This includes gathering requirements, understanding the client's needs, and establishing the project's objectives and priorities.

2. Agile Planning: In the following stage of the agile development process, the team develops a backlog of user stories, features, or tasks and prioritizes them in accordance with the goals and need of the customer.  The team then estimates how much work will be expected for each item and schedules the work to be completed in sprints or time-boxed periods known as iterations.

3. Iterative Development: Agile is an iterative strategy in which the team works in brief sprints or iterations that often run 1-4 weeks. The team chooses a number of items from the backlog to work on collectively during each sprint. Daily stand-up meetings are held by the team to discuss difficulties, assess progress, and communicate updates.

4. Continuous Integration and Testing: Agile places a strong emphasis on continuous integration and automated testing. To find defects and make sure the product satisfies quality requirements, developers frequently merge their code into a common repository. This assists in finding problems early on and fixing them, lowering the possibility of faults and raising the general level of software quality.

5. Customer Feedback and Review: Agile development promotes regular customer reviews and feedback. The team presents the finished product to the client or product owner for feedback at the conclusion of each sprint. With this feedback, the backlog is improved and prioritized, and the project's course is adjusted depending on the demands and expectations of the client.

6. Continuous Improvement: Agile development is an active method that promotes ongoing progress. To improve their development techniques, teamwork, and customer happiness, the team routinely evaluates their work, identifies areas for improvement, and makes adjustments. During the course of the project, the team can adjust and get better thanks to this iterative feedback loop.

7. Delivery & Deployment: As the project moves forward, the team keeps building and perfecting the program, and the client offers input to direct more iterations. The program is prepared for deployment to production after it satisfies the customer's requirements and clears all essential tests. Agile development enables frequent releases, allowing the team to swiftly and continually provide value to the client.

8. Monitoring and Maintenance: Upon deployment, the team keeps track of the program in use, gathers user input, and fixes any defects or issues that come up. Agile development is aware that software is a dynamic product, and that maintenance and upgrades may be necessary in response to shifting needs or client feedback.
