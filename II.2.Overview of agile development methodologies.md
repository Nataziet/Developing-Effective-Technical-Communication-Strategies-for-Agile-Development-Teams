# **Overview of agile development methodologies**

|= Agile development strategies are iterative, collaborative software creation methods that focus on adaptation, flexibility, and continual improvement. Rapid feedback loops, cross-functional team cooperation, and incremental software delivery characterize them. Agile approaches encourage a team-based, flexible approach that enables teams to adjust as requirements and client feedback change throughout the development process.

Some of the most popular Agile methodologies include Scrum, Kanban, Lean, and Extreme Programming (XP). 

* **Scrum** is an agile approach for software development that emphasizes the delivery of software iteratively and incrementally. It is founded on a set of values and procedures that prioritize cooperation, teamwork, and ongoing development. Cross-functional teams collaborate in Scrum during brief, time-boxed iterations called sprints, which typically span two to four weeks.
Work in Scrum is organized in a backlog, which is a prioritized list of features, user stories, or tasks. Each sprint, the team selects a set of items from the backlog to work on, and the team works together to complete those items. Daily stand-up meetings are held to facilitate communication and coordination among team members, and progress is tracked using visual boards, such as Kanban boards or burndown charts.

* **Kanban** is an agile framework used for the purpose of streamlining workflow and boosting productivity by visualizing and managing work in progress (WIP). It originated from Lean manufacturing practices and has been widely adopted in software development and other industries. It focuses on visualizing and optimizing the workflow, limiting WIP, and continuously improving the efficiency.
Kanban is a fluid and adaptive method of work management that enables teams to adjust to shifting demands and priorities. It is a well-liked agile framework for managing work in a variety of fields, including software development, operations, and project management, because it encourages transparency, efficiency, and continual improvement.

* **Lean** is an ideology and set of guiding principles that originated from the manufacturing industry and has been applied to various domains, including software development. By implementing a continuous improvement process, it aims to increase customer value while reducing waste.
In software development, Lean principles are applied to streamline processes, reduce unnecessary work, and ensure that only the most valuable features are developed and delivered to customers. Lean emphasizes the importance of feedback loops, measurement, and data-driven decision-making to continuously improve processes and products. It encourages cross-functional collaboration, empowerment of team members, and a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

* **Extreme Programming (XP)** is an agile software development approach that strongly relies on frequent feedback loops and close team cooperation to create high-quality software. Iterative and adaptable, XP concentrates on client satisfaction and the capacity to adjust to shifting demands.
Developers collaborate closely with customers, testers, and other stakeholders throughout the development process under the XP methodology, which places a strong focus on communication and teamwork. The approach encourages the implementation of minimal, clean code and supports continuous integration and testing together with simple, frequent releases.
One of the key principles of XP is "embrace change", recognizing that requirements can evolve and change over time, and that software should be able to accommodate these changes. =|
