# **How Agile differs from traditional software development methodologies**

There are some important differences between agile and traditional software development approaches.

1. Approach to Change: Agile techniques are made to be adaptive and flexible, and they accept change as a normal part of the software development process. On the other hand, traditional techniques have a tendency to be more inflexible and oppose modifications after the project has begun, which frequently causes delays and increases expenses.

2. Focus on Customer Collaboration: Agile development approaches place a strong emphasis on tight customer collaboration throughout the development process, including engaging them in decision-making and collecting feedback to influence development. Traditional methods frequently include limited customers involvement and may not provide as much importance to their feedback.

3. Iterative and Incremental Development: Agile approaches apply an iterative and incremental approach, in which software is built in tiny, manageable chunks, enabling regular feedback and revisions. The waterfall technique used by traditional approaches, in which each stage of the development process must be finished before moving on to the next, can lead to lengthier development cycles and delayed feedback.

4. Team Collaboration and Empowerment: Agile approaches place a strong emphasis on self-organizing, cross-functional teams that work closely together and take decisions as a group. The hierarchical structure of traditional techniques, together with clearly defined roles and tasks, may impede team empowerment and cooperation.

5. Emphasis on Working Software: The delivery of functional software is prioritized by agile techniques as the main indicator of progress and success. Older techniques could place more of an emphasis on planning and documentation than they might on producing usable software early in the project.

6. Continuous Improvement: Agile methodologies promote a culture of continuous improvement, encouraging regular reflection, learning, and adaptation. Traditional approaches may rely more on preset procedures and goals and may not place the same focus on ongoing development.

7. Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile techniques are intended to be adaptive and flexible, allowing for changes in objectives, priorities, and technology.  Traditional techniques could take a more rigorous stance and have less room for adjustment during the development process.

Agile techniques are different from traditional software development methodologies in how they approach change, interact with customers, create iteratively and incrementally, empower teams, place a focus on usable product, and are flexible. Agile approaches are known for their versatility, customer-centric outlook, and iterative style, enabling speedier feedback and more effective development cycles.
